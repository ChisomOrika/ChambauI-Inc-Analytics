# Project Overview
=======

This project is focused on utilizing dbt, a data transformation tool and Python to build a data pipeline that simulates Chambau datasets. The datasets contain information about orders, deliveries and reviews. The pipeline will transform this raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis and reporting in downstream applications. 

### Tech stack and functions

DBT: For data cleaning and transformation <br>
Python: Data extraction and loading <br>
Amazon s3: Data lake <br>
Postgres : Data warehouse <br>
PowerBI : BI tool for developing dashboard <br>
