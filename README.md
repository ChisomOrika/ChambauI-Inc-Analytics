# Project Overview
=======

This project is focused on utilizing dbt, a data transformation tool and Python to build a data pipeline that simulates Chambau datasets. The datasets contain information about orders, deliveries and reviews. The pipeline will transform this raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis and reporting in downstream applications. 
Welcome to your new dbt project!
